# Quant-Projects
Quantitative Finance - Projects, Algorithms, Ideas etc.
## Introduction
This repository consist a few things. Firstly, the Intro to Quant module. The world of finance is quite sectretive, with the vast majority of projects online having either results that are statistically garbage or using outdated models, namely econometrics, I try to give my perspective of how to create models as well as educating in time series analysis.  Secondly, my old projects. These are quite sporadic projects that were done in the beginning of our quantitative finance journey. The backtesting is below the bar, but they show the development process during the years and highlight potential pitfalls. I will probably annotate them better in due time.
